## Introduction

Model-Based Development (MBD) is a methodology that uses models as the core artifacts in the development process. It involves creating abstract representations of a system and using these models for analysis, design, and implementation. This section provides a brief introduction to MBD and its benefits.

The **Battery Management System (BMS)** is a critical component in modern electrical energy storage solutions, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of battery packs. This project is part of the OS Academy Diploma program and aims to develop a robust BMS through a structured **V-Model software development process**. The repository contains all necessary documentation and artifacts for each development phase.

The **V-Model** is a software development methodology that emphasizes validation and verification at every stage. Each phase in the model has a corresponding testing phase, ensuring the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohmed-ahmed-01097/Battery-Management-System.git
   cd MAAM-BMS-Project
   ```

2. **Review Requirements (SWE.1 SRS)**  

   - Start by reading the SRS to understand the system goals and constraints.

3. **Explore Design & Implementation**  

   - Check out the ADD (SWE.2) and CDD (SWE.3) for architectural insights and detailed component designs.

4. **Testing**  

   - As you develop or modify code, refer to UTD (SWE.4) for unit tests.  
   - Integration and system verification (SWE.5 ITD-VTD) will follow once unit testing is stable.

5. **Qualification & Final Validation**  

   - When all tests pass and the system is verified, proceed to final qualification (SWE.6 QTD).

## How to Navigate

1. **SWE.1 SRS**  
   - Start here to understand the complete set of requirements the BMS must fulfill.  
   - Contains references to system-level and software-level needs, performance targets, and regulatory compliance requirements.

2. **SWE.2 ADD**  
   - Review the top-level architecture to see how major components (e.g., State Machine, SOC Estimator, Balancing Logic) interact.  
   - Useful for system integration and understanding data flow.

3. **SWE.3 CDD**  
   - Delve deeper into the design of each component, including data structures, functions, and algorithms.  
   - Reference this for low-level development and unit test planning.

4. **SWE.4 UTD**  
   - Check out the detailed unit test cases and procedures to ensure each module functions as intended.  
   - Work-in-progress; contributions are welcome to expand and refine test coverage.

5. **SWE.5 ITD-VTD**  
   - Find plans for integrating the modules into a cohesive system and verifying the overall functionality.  
   - Will be populated once the unit testing phase nears completion.

6. **SWE.6 QTD**  
   - Final qualification tests, addressing system performance, reliability, and compliance.  
   - Will be created closer to project completion to validate against all requirements.
